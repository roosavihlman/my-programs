Programs I have done in SAMK.

There are comments used in files so that they are easy to follow as they are made for teachers to check.


EightQueens problem's explanation can be found e.g. here: https://www.datagenetics.com/blog/august42012/.
Putting it short, there should be 8 queens (or how many queens you like) to be set to chess board so that they don't threaten each other's. I wanted to try to solve this problem so that I don't seek any ideas how it could be solved. Finally, I used recursive solution.

In TehtavienJako problem there needed to make an algorithm which makes a sift list according to employees dayoffs, skills, how many work days max can be set for one employee in a list, how many work days max in a row can be set for one employee and how many employees per skill per day is needed. It wasn't necessary to make "perfect" shift list. The target was to make a shift list with as few faults as possible. E.g. employee has a demand that she/he can work max 4 days in a list but the algorithm calculates 5 days for her/him. The less faults the better list is.

Secondwatch React-project was funny task that we needed to do in reactive programming course. We also needed to do Netlify-website from our final solution. My final UI can be found here:
